    <h1>Fantastic epic music is here</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Epic music is a modern classical-like musical genre derived from a wide array of genres, primarily trailer music.</p>
    <p>The first official trailer music companies, which later became epic music producers, were created in the 1990s, with Immediate Music being one of the first starting as early as 1993. From then until the 2010s, many albums and single tracks were created; however they were only available to the companiesâ€™ clients and the film industry. Until this day only few of these albums have been officially, or unofficially through Internet platforms, released to the public. It was around 2005-2010 some composers started to pick up public fame for the first time, thanks to their songs being featured at special events like the Olympic Games and the many trailers they composed for.</p>
